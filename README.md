## Number Guess

Number Guess is a simple game built with React Native app that allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The app itself is a **Typescript** version that I wrote based on the original application from the **React Native - The Practical Guide 2025 by Maximilian Schwarzmüller** written in **JavaScript**. The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface, with features such as:

- Start a new game by entering a number and confirming the input
- Get feedback on whether the entered number is higher or lower than the target number
- Track the number of guesses made and the number of rounds played
- View the history of guesses made in each round
- Reset the game and start a new round

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guess.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
3. Start the app:
```shell
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Open the app on your device or emulator.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 and tap the "confirm" button.
3. The app will provide feedback on whether the entered number is higher or lower than the target number.
4. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.
5. After each round, you can tap the "Start New Game" button to start a new round with a new target number.
